## Dataset
Dataset used for train and validation: [ILSVRC2012](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/). 

Check [imagenet_prep](../imagenet_prep.md) for guidelines on preparing the dataset.
## Example notebook
View the notebook [imagenet_inference](../imagenet_inference.ipynb) to understand how to use above models for doing inference. Make sure to specify the appropriate model name in the notebook
## Training notebook
Use the notebook [train_vgg](train_vgg.ipynb) to train the model. It contains the hyperparameters and network details used for training the above models
## Validation accuracy
The accuracies obtained by the models on the validation set are shown in the table below: 

|Model        |Top-1 error (%)|Top-5 error (%)|
|-------------|:--------------|:--------------|
|vgg16        |     27.38     |      8.86     |
|vgg16_bn     |     27.29     |      8.79     |
|vgg19        |     26.28     |      8.42     |
|vgg19_bn     |     26.16     |      8.21     |

Use the notebook [imagenet_verify](../imagenet_verify.ipynb) to verify the accuracy of the model on the validation set. Make sure to specify the appropriate model name in the notebook.
